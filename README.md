# [NMS Wiki Page Creator](http://wiki.nmscd.com/)
# No Man's Sky - Wiki page creation website!

This is a website intended for making wiki page creation in the [No Man's Sky Wiki](https://nomanssky.fandom.com) easier.

It was originally forked from seamonkey420 who made this in 2017 as a batch script.

To make it more cross platform, with console gamers and other operating systems in mind, it has been ported to the web.

The website was created by [Lenni](https://nomanssky.fandom.com/wiki/User:Lenni009).<br>
Which was expanded by [Muhaddil](https://nomanssky.fandom.com/wiki/User:Muhaddil).
